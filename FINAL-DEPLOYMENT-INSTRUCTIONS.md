# Vercel Deployment - Final Instructions

Since we're having challenges with automated terminal scripts, here's the simplest way to deploy your site:

## Step 1: Build Your Project Locally

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/stynerstiner/Downloads/FHStudios
   ```
3. Build your project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Verify the `dist` folder is created with your built files

## Step 2: Deploy Using Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Create a New Account** if you don't have one:
   - Use your GitHub account for easiest setup
   - Or use your email: stynerdev2025@aol.com

3. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - If prompted to import from Git, choose "Import Third-Party Git Repository" and enter your GitHub repo URL
   - Or use "Upload" to upload your local files

4. **Configure the Project**:
   - Project Name: fhstudios
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: npm run build (skip if uploading your local build)
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete
   - You'll receive a URL like https://fhstudios.vercel.app

## Step 3: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your site URL
2. Test the content editing with `?edit=your-token` in the URL
3. Verify all functionality works correctly

## Bonus: Add Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow the DNS setup instructions
