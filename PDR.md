## Current Status: READY FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT ✅

We've completed steps 1-6, and the implementation is complete. The site is now ready for manual deployment to Vercel:

1. All components have been made editable
2. ContentTools has been successfully integrated
3. API endpoints for saving and uploading content are in place
4. Security via token validation is implemented
5. All TypeScript and ESLint errors have been fixed
6. Pre-deploy quality checks have passed
7. Deployment configuration is ready

Please use the FINAL-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md file for step-by-step manual deployment guidance.

## Next Actions:

1. Deploy manually via Vercel Dashboard (see FINAL-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. Complete post-deployment testing
3. Provide documentation to client on how to use the editing features

## Next Actions:

1. Run the deployment script to deploy to Vercel
2. Complete post-deployment testing
3. Provide documentation to client on how to use the editing features

## Enhanced Project Documentation

We've added the following documentation for a professional deployment:

1. **CLIENT-EDITING-GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for clients on how to edit content
2. **VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step instructions for Vercel deployment
